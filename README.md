# Data-Science-Project-1
## Overview

### Project Goal & Question
The goal of this project was to analyze the relationship between median income of a county and how that might affect its COVID fatality rates, total cases, and total deaths. We wondered, “Would a higher median income lead to a lower fatality rate, and vice versa?”.

### Background
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Most people who catch COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people become severely ill. Over 44 Million people in the United States have gotten COVID-19. Over 700 Thousand people in the United States have died from COVID-19. Vaccines have been developed against COVID-19 to effectively protect populations

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted different states and counties disproportionately and various factors are responsible, whether they be people’s lack of adherence to CDC guidelines or larger populations in more dense areas. The specific factor that we Team Zeta will be looking at is the role income may have on the severity of different areas COVID-19 numbers. 
Data Source & Background
In our exploration, we used income data as well as COVID cases and deaths data. Our income data is from the U.S. Census Bureau. Variables from that dataset include county and median income, grouped by different income brackets. Our COVID data is from the New York Times Github. Variables in this dataset include date, county, state, fips, cases, and deaths.

The US Census Bureau and New York Times are very reputable sources. The US Census Bureau’s data collection methods are well documented and shown on their website and NYT’s data collection procedures are well documented and especially cognizant of possible errors in recent COVID data reporting. The Github explains discrepancies in the data as well as their own analysis on how reliable it is.
What potential errors might be in the data? 
Potential errors include missing data. The county data we work with isn’t perfect; we’re missing about 22 counties out of 3,242 total counties. The US Census may have pre-selected for a number of counties based on their own criteria that they want to analyze, or may have omitted certain counties based on how they categorize territories.

Another error includes the reporting of accurate COVID data. “On several occasions, officials have corrected information hours or days after first reporting it. At times, cases have disappeared from a local government database, or officials have moved a patient first identified in one state or county to another, often with no explanation. In those instances, which have become more common as the number of cases has grown…”
